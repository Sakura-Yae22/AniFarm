AniFarm is a discord bot made in order to reduce manual labour people faced during managing their AniGame community. The main purpose of this bot is to handle the vast number of farmers complaining about roles/orders and also to reduce scam (sometimes).    

Invite the bot using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=816544600118132747&permissions=137707899968&scope=bot%20applications.commands).    
Join the [support server](https://discord.gg/wR8uJkT9NT) for extra help.
